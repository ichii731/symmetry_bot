## Tech Stack

[Backend]

Python / PHP

[Libraries]

Pip Installs Packages(Python)

- Pillow==8.3.1
- face_recognition ([GitHub Repo](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition))

Composer (PHP)

- abraham/twitteroauth: ^2.0
- vlucas/phpdotenv: ^5.3

[Other]

- Systemd.Timer (Ubuntu 20.04 LTS)

## Notice

The pip library "face_recognition" runs in C++, so **it may not work well on cloud platforms such as Heroku** (see the official repository for details).

The Twitter API processing is done in PHP and the image processing is done in Python, which makes no sense to me...

So I've put it under MIT license, but it's better not to refer to this repo.
